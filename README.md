# Morph Adorner Toolkit
Morph Adorner Toolkit is a set of Java tools for the easy access of Morph Adorner's functionalities.
Its goal is to allow for one to easily exploit the tools made available by the Morph Adorner [1][2] project by calling stand-alone JARs from scripts in any language.

# Installing and Running
Clone the project in a folder of your choice, then call the JARs in the following fashion for instructions:
	
	java -jar <Tool>.jar -h

All tools receive the input from STDIN and provide the output in STDOUT.
