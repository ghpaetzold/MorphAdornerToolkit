# Morph Adorner Toolkit
Morph Adorner Toolkit is a set of Java tools for the easy access of Morph Adorner's functionalities.
Its goal is to allow for one to easily exploit the tools made available by the Morph Adorner project (Burns, 2013) by calling stand-alone JARs from scripts in any language.

# Installing and Running
Clone the project in a folder of your choice, then call the JARs in the following fashion for instructions:
	
	java -jar <Tool>.jar -h

All tools receive the input from STDIN and provide the output in STDOUT.
All tools' sources are distributed as Netbeans projects.
